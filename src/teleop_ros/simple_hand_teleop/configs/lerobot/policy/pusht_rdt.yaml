# Note: We do not track EMA model weights as we discovered it does not improve the results. See

  #   weight: This represents the multinomial probability (with no replacement)
  #           used for sampling the transform. If the sum of the weights is not 1,
  #           they will be normalized.
  #   min_max: Lower & upper bound respectively used for sampling the transform's parameter
  #           (following uniform distribution) when it's applied.
